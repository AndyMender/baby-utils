Basic programs written in the C programming language.

This is a small set of stand-alone C source files written for coding practice. Shared for possible feedback and posterity :).

Programs:
dictlook - a simple 2-function program that opens a file-based dictionary database and looks for a definition of a command-line specified entry (example file dictionary provided)
talkie - a simple AI algorithm that tries to build a relationship with the user based on how well his/her answers match the expectations of the AI
t_World - a "Hello, World!" program with a loop including sleep() to test multi-threading via POSIX threads (pthreads); pthread needs to be linked during compilation via "-lpthread"
